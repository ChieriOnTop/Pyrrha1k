# Pyrrha1k

Hello! I know this can look a little confusing considering the fact that there are 2 files here with absolutely nothing to go off of.
To give a little context if you've somehow found this repo, this was an overnight trained AI model of Pyrrha from RWBY, strictly trained off of voice clips from volumes 1-4 and a few small clips from a RWBY game I already forgot the name of.

If you would like to test out my AI and you're a beginner, you're welcome to download and extract this GitHub repo and use it for yourself or for friends, I may be updating this from time to time but as of now, I think it sounds good. 
I won't give any tutorial on how to use the AI however, but I can redirect you to an easy to follow guide which is fairly easy to use.

Have fun!
